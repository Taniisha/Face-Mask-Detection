# Face-Mask-Detection

The basic aim of the project is to detect the presence of a face mask on human faces on live streaming video as well as on images.
It is done in 2 parts - 
In first part we create a CNN model for predictions.
In second part using openCV and haarcascade files we will detect the face and outline it in real time frame.
